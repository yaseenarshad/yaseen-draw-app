/**
 * Open in default app (YAZ-1577) — the third read-only OS verb beside `reveal` and `openInVsCode`,
 * deliberately the same shape: stat first so a stale row (deleted or moved externally) reports
 * `NOT_FOUND` for the caller's passive notice, no dot-entry and no extension guard. This is how a
 * file the app has no viewer for (`kind: null` in the tree) gets opened at all — the OS decides
 * which application, exactly as a Finder double-click would.
 *
 * `shell.openPath` differs from `openExternal` in one way that matters: it never throws, it
 * RETURNS the OS' message (`''` on success). That string is the whole error contract.
