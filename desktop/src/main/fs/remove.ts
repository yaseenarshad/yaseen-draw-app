/**
 * In-app delete (GRO-2272 — decision A, LOCKED): the entry moves to the SYSTEM TRASH.
 *
 * `shell.trashItem` and nothing else. There is deliberately NO `fs.rm` anywhere in this
 * module, and no permanent-delete fallback when the trash call fails: a filesystem with no
 * Trash (a network volume, some external drives) is exactly the situation where the user's
 * recovery story has just disappeared, so destroying the file instead would hand them the
 * opposite of what they asked for. A failed trash refuses loudly (`IO_ERROR`) and leaves the
 * entry untouched on disk. `remove.test.ts` asserts the file survives, which is what stops a
 * future "helpful" fallback being added.
 *
 * Guards mirror `rename.ts` where they transfer, and only where they transfer:
 *  - entries the tree/index/watcher hide (dot-entries like `.yaseendocs` / `.obsidian` /
 *    `.trash`, and `node_modules`) are invisible infrastructure, so deleting one through a UI
 *    that never showed it is refused (`BAD_REQUEST`). The check reuses `isSkipped` rather than
 *    testing for a leading dot, so this guard cannot drift from the rule that justifies it;
 *  - the extension-kind rules do NOT apply (nothing is being renamed), and deletion is not
 *    restricted to the supported-file discovery set: the tree shows EVERY folder regardless of
 *    what is inside it, so every folder must be deletable;
 *  - the calling window's own vault root is refused upstream in `ipc/fs.ts`, which is the
 *    only layer that knows who is calling — same split as rename.
 *
 * `shell.trashItem` is a MOVE at the filesystem layer, so the shared watcher emits a normal
 * `unlink` (files) or `unlinkDir` + one `unlink` per descendant (folders) — verified against
 * the app's own chokidar options in the GRO-2275 scope pass. The tree and the vault index
 * therefore heal themselves and need no push, exactly as rename relies on.
