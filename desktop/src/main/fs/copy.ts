 * `BAD_REQUEST` (an infinite copy); a missing source is `NOT_FOUND`. The target folder is
 * `pasteEntries`'s to check (ONE door: it is this function's only production caller). No
 * extension rules: nothing is renamed, the copy keeps its name and kind.
 *
 * Nothing downstream: no store repair (nothing moved or went) and no push (the watcher's
 * `add`/`addDir` echo fills the tree, and the client refreshes anyway — idempotent).
