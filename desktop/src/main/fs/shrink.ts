/**
 * "MOVE PICTURES OUT OF BOARDS" (YAZ-1801 D5) — Settings › Storage's one action: every legacy
 * board in the vault that still embeds its pictures as base64 is rewritten LEAN, the way its next
 * save would have written it, without waiting for someone to open and edit each one.
 *
 * It is the save's own extraction (`liftEmbedded` + `landAssets` in `drawing.ts`), not a second
 * set of rules: referenced pictures land in `assets/` first (`wx`, EEXIST ok — two boards sharing
 * one picture store it once), THEN the lean scene replaces the board atomically, so a crash can
 * leave an unreferenced asset (the orphan sweep's business) but never a board naming bytes that
 * are not there. Unreferenced embedded entries are dropped, as a save drops them.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO — the difference from a save, and the reason this is not `drawing:save`:
 * it does not STAMP. The `yaseendraw` block (🔒 YAZ-1834) rides through verbatim — same keys,
 * same values, same place — because moving bytes between files is not an edit, and "Last updated"
 * jumping on forty boards the user never touched would be a lie in the sidebar's sort. The text is
 * re-serialized the way every board main writes (2-space, trailing newline).
 *
 * NEVER THROWS PER BOARD. A board it cannot read, parse, or write — or one in `skip` (the renderer
 * passes boards with unsaved edits in a tab: rewriting under a dirty buffer is exactly the
 * conflict bar's case), or one that changed on disk while it was being read — counts as skipped
 * and the walk goes on. Boards with nothing embedded are neither shrunk nor skipped.
 *
 * Clean open tabs need nothing from here: the rewrite is an ordinary external change, and the
 * editor's watcher rule reloads a clean tab silently (`DrawingEditor` — echo / reload / conflict).
