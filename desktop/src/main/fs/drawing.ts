/**
 * THE DRAWING DOCUMENT'S TWO DOORS (🔒 YAZ-1810).
 *
 * `drawing:load` and `drawing:save` are the ONLY way a `.excalidraw` opened AS A DOCUMENT reads
 * and writes. One door per DIRECTION, not one per artefact, because a scene and the image bytes
 * it names are ONE thing: a load is "the scene, then its images", a save is "the images, then the
 * scene", and splitting either across two calls would let a renderer land half of it — a scene on
 * disk naming bytes that are not there.
 *
 * The read ceiling is `MAX_DRAWING_BYTES` (200 MiB): a LEGACY scene — an upstream export, or one
 * an older build wrote — embeds its images as base64 and is routinely past 10 MiB before it has
 * been opened once. The cap exists to refuse a file that has stopped being a document, not to
 * police normal ones.
 *
 * THE SCENE IS VALIDATED HERE, not only in the renderer: a corrupt or empty `.excalidraw` comes
 * back as one `IO_ERROR` naming the path, which the editor shows as a readable error pane. The
 * check is deliberately the OUTLINE only (an object with an `elements` array) — the file is user
 * data, and the engine's own `restore()` is what decides whether those elements are a scene.
 *
 * Requests cross IPC from a sandboxed renderer, so their shape is checked like a request body,
 * never trusted from the type.
 *
 * 🔒 YAZ-1775 D3 ON DISK: the scene carries `files: {}`; image elements keep only their `fileId`; the
 * bytes sit at `<root>/assets/<fileId>.<ext>` (the engine's own SHA-1 id, the mime's extension).
 * An asset is IMMUTABLE — the same bytes always get the same name — so a save never rewrites one
 * (`wx`; EEXIST means it is already exactly these bytes). A LEGACY export that still embeds
 * `files` opens (its entries pass straight through the load) and SHRINKS on its first save:
 * `liftEmbedded` takes the referenced bytes out of the scene and `landAssets` writes them into the
 * store, then the scene is written lean. Settings › Storage's "Move pictures out" (`shrink.ts`,
 * YAZ-1801 D5) runs the same two helpers over every legacy board at once.
 *
 * ASSETS FIRST, THEN THE SCENE. A scene on disk must never name bytes that are not there, so
 * every asset lands before the file that references it. The reverse order would leave a crash
 * window in which the document is broken; this order's worst case is an unreferenced asset,
 * which the orphan sweep collects a day later.
 *
 * A REFERENCED ID WITH NO BYTES ANYWHERE is left OUT of the response rather than raised as an
 * error: the engine draws its missing-image placeholder and the document still opens. Losing a
 * picture must never cost the user the board it was on.
 *
 * THE `yaseendraw` BLOCK (🔒 YAZ-1834 D3) rides the same atomic write. The engine's serializer
 * drops keys it does not know, so the renderer never sends the block back; the save re-reads it
 * off the CURRENT file's head, keeps `createdAt` (and every key the backfill put there, D5), sets
 * `updatedAt` to now, and `stampBoardMeta` places it first. A board with no block is born one on
 * this save, aged by its pre-save mtime. This happens after the conflict guard and the assets, so
 * a refused save stamps nothing and a stamped scene never names bytes that are not there.
 *
 * Pure rules (`referencedFileIds`, `stripEmbeddedFiles`, `stampBoardMeta`, …) live in
 * `shared/drawingAssets.ts`; this file is the fs around them.
