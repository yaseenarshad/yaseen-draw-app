/**
 * One sync pass (YAZ-1081 2B): everything "make this vault and its GitHub remote agree" means,
 * as a single async function of a root that answers with a `GithubSyncStatus` and never throws.
 *
 * The order is fixed and load-bearing — commit, fetch, rebase, push:
 *   - COMMIT FIRST so the rebase has a clean tree to move. Nothing here ever stashes; a stash is
 *     a place work can be forgotten, and this app's promise is that the user's notes are always
 *     on disk exactly as they left them. ONE exception (🔒 YAZ-1801 D12): a TRACKED file held back
 *     as too large is the one edit a commit can never absorb, and it would make the rebase refuse
 *     ("unstaged changes"). Only those files are parked for the length of the rebase and their
 *     exact bytes copied back straight after (`parkWhileRebasing`) — files sync will never commit
 *     anyway, restored by a copy, never a merge.
 *   - REBASE, never merge. Two machines editing different notes replay cleanly and the history
 *     stays a line anyone can read in the GitHub UI.
 *   - A rebase that CONFLICTS is settled and finished (YAZ-1897, `resolve.ts`): boards merge shape
 *     by shape, anything else keeps both copies, and the pass reports what it merged. Only what
 *     cannot be settled is aborted (the lossless rule, YAZ-1081): git puts the working tree back
 *     byte-for-byte and the pass reports `attention/conflict`. A vault is never left in a
 *     half-finished rebase, and no `<<<<<<<` marker ever lands in a user's file.
 *
 * Every failure is CLASSIFIED rather than thrown (`classifyGitFailure`), because the three kinds
 * want three different responses: offline is not the user's problem (retry quietly), auth is
 * (say so once), anything else is worth showing verbatim. `syncPass` is stateless — the cadence,
 * the retries and the debounce all live in `manager.ts`.

 *  - AFTER `add -A`: the staged list is checked again and anything over the limit is unstaged
 *    (`reset -q -- <file>`) — the belt for a file that grew between the stat and the add.
 *
 * Returns the vault-relative paths held back. OUT OF SCOPE (noted, not handled): a file that
 * was already COMMITTED over the limit by an earlier build or by hand — that commit is in the
