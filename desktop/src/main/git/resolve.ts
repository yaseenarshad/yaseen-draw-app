/**
 * A REBASE THAT STOPPED ON CONFLICTS, FINISHED INSTEAD OF ABANDONED (🔒 YAZ-1897 D1–D4).
 *
 * Before this, any conflict aborted the pass and the whole vault stopped syncing until a person
 * untangled it by hand. Now each conflicted file is settled where it stands and the rebase goes on
 * — still a rebase, never a merge commit, so history stays one readable line:
 *  - a BOARD merges shape by shape (`mergeBoards`, D1). Git never line-merges a board at all (D2,
 *    `ensureBoardMergeRule`), so every board both machines changed arrives here;
 *  - the vault's `shares.json` and `favorites.json` merge per entry, and any other `.yaseendraw/`
 *    config keeps ours (a conflicted copy nobody sees would only be clutter);
 *  - anything else — prose, a board that will not parse, two unrelated new boards at one path —
 *    KEEPS BOTH (D3): the remote's version at the path, ours beside it as
 *    `<name> (conflict, YYYY-MM-DD).<ext>`;
 *  - a file one side deleted and the other edited keeps the edit.
 *
 * THE LOSSLESS RULE STILL HOLDS. Anything this cannot settle — a git step that fails, a stop that
 * is not a conflict — aborts the rebase exactly as before, and the caller reports `conflict`.
 * One thing the old abort could NOT protect: an autosave that lands while the rebase is stopped.
 * `rebase --abort` resets it away and an unstaged edit blocks `--continue`, so before either one
 * every dirty tracked file is PARKED by copy (bytes held, file checked out) and written back once
 * the rebase is over — the YAZ-1801 D12 idiom, by copy, never by merge.
 *
 * Stage numbers inside a rebase are easy to get backwards: 2 is the UPSTREAM (theirs), 3 is the
 * local commit being replayed (ours). Every read goes through `checkout-index --temp`, so no file
 * — a 40 MB board, a picture — ever squeezes through a stdout buffer.
