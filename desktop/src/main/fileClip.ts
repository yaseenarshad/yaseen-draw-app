/**
 * The ONE app-wide file clipboard (YAZ-1674, D1): what Cut / Copy in ANY window's sidebar put
 * here, and what Paste in ANY window takes out. It lives in main — not in a renderer, which
 * cannot cross windows, and not on the OS clipboard, whose Electron file-list write is a
 * macOS-only `public.file-url` that is flaky for many files (Finder interop, Future YAZ-1707) — so
 * cutting in a window on vault A and pasting in a window on vault B is the same gesture as
 * pasting within one vault.
 *
 * Session-only and NEVER persisted: a clipboard that survived a relaunch would offer a paste of
 * paths nobody remembers cutting. No Electron import, so it unit-tests in plain node; the IPC
 * layer (`ipc/fs.ts`) wires `onChange` to the `clip:changed` push every window gets.
