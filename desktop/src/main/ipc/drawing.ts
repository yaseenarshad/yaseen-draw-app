/**
 * The drawing document's IPC (🔒 YAZ-1810): `fs/drawing.ts` behind the standard envelope, and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * NO STORE REPAIR AND NO BROADCAST: repair and the pushes exist for paths that MOVE or GO, and a
 * save does neither — it changes bytes at a path every
 * window already knows. A window with the same document open learns of the change from the
 * shared watcher, like any edit made outside the app, and decides for itself (reload when clean,
 * the conflict bar when dirty). One writer telling the others what to think would be a second,
 * competing truth about a file the disk already answers for.
 *
 * THE ORPHAN SWEEP (🔒 D3, YAZ-1811) is not an IPC of its own. `ipc/fs.ts` calls
 * `sweepVaultOnce` after answering the FIRST `fs:tree` for a root in this session — the moment a
 * vault is "opened" — DETACHED, so the tree answer never waits on it, and its result rides the
 * requesting window's existing passive notice channel ("Cleaned N unused images"), and only when
 * it actually did something. Silence is the right report for a sweep that found nothing.
