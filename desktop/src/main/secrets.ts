/**
 * THE SECRETS DOOR (🔒 YAZ-1842 D1, amending YAZ-1775 D4; YAZ-1817): `userData/secrets.json` =
 * `{ version: 2, values: Record<name, value> }`, plain text, owner-only (mode 0600).
 *
 * THE RULE, and it has no exceptions: **the renderer never receives a value.** It may write one
 * (`set`) and ask whether one is there (`has`); reading (`read`) is main's alone — YAZ-1818's provider
 * code calls it when it builds a Pixabay request. That is why the Pixabay key is not a
 * `SettingsState` field: the store is broadcast to every window on every change, and a key in it
 * would be a key in every renderer's devtools console.
 *
 * WHY PLAIN TEXT (YAZ-1842). Version 1 encrypted values with Electron's `safeStorage`, which on
 * macOS keys on a Keychain item bound to the app's code identity. This app is ad-hoc signed (no
 * Developer ID, locked), so every build is a different identity to the Keychain: a key written by
 * one build could not be read by the next, `has` answered false, and the Settings row looked
 * broken. The file lives in the user's own Library, never in a vault, and is readable only by the
 * user — the same protection as an `.env` file. A version-1 file is treated as corrupt (moved
 * aside), so the next paste starts clean rather than half-migrating blobs nobody can open.
 *
 * Lazy, like every other file this app owns: reading never creates the file; a corrupt one is
 * moved aside as `secrets.json.corrupt-<epoch>` (the `store.ts` posture). Writes are atomic and
 * chained.
