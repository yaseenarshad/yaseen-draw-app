/**
 * THE LIBRARY'S COMPONENT STORE (🔒 YAZ-1775 D5, YAZ-1819): `<library>/components/<slug>.excalidraw` +
 * `<slug>.png`, indexed by `<library>/components.json`, shared by every vault's windows. The rules
 * live in `@shared/savedComponents`; this module is the disk half — read lazily, write atomically,
 * trash through the OS, watch for the other writers.
 *
 * THE FOLDER IS THE TRUTH, THE INDEX IS A CACHE. Every read reconciles the index against what is
 * actually in `components/`: a fragment the index does not know is adopted (named after its own
 * slug, counted by reading it once), a row whose file has gone drops out, and an index that is
 * missing or is not a version-1 index at all is rebuilt from the folder — the corrupt one moved
 * aside as `components.json.corrupt-<epoch>`, the `store.ts` posture. This is what makes a
 * component that arrived through a synced folder show up without anything having to repair itself,
 * and what makes a file deleted in Finder stop being offered.
 *
 * A READ NEVER WRITES. The reconciliation happens in memory; the file is only ever written by a
 * mutation, which writes the reconciled index WITH its change. So listing a library on a read-only
 * disk works, and nothing churns a synced folder just by being looked at.
 *
 * Mutations serialise on one promise chain (two windows saving in the same tick are two
 * read-modify-writes and interleaving them would lose one), and a mutation that changes nothing
 * does not write.
 *
 * Watching is `watchedFolder.ts`'s, at depth 1 — `components.json` beside `components/`, and
 * everything inside it — pushed to every window as `components:changed`. An own write notifies
 * this process's subscribers synchronously and its watcher echo is dropped by path + mtime.
 *
 * THE FOLDER SCAN IS CACHED ON ITS OWN mtime. Reconciling costs a `readdir` plus a `stat` per
 * fragment, and `components:changed` makes every window re-list; a folder whose mtime has not
 * moved since the last scan cannot have gained or lost a file, so that scan is reused.
 *
 * TRASH, NEVER `rm` (the app's rule for every delete): `shell.trashItem` comes in as an argument,
 * so this module stays Electron-free and its tests run on a temp folder with a spy.
