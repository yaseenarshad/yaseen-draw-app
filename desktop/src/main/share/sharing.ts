/**
 * SHARING, MAIN'S HALF (YAZ-1799). Owns everything a renderer must never hold:
 * the Cloudflare API token, the Worker's upload password, and every HTTP call. Electron-free —
 * `fetch`, `secrets.ts`, `vaultConfig.ts` and a JSON file in userData — so it tests against a stub.
 *
 *  - `<userData>/sharing.json`: which account, bucket and Worker were provisioned, the
 *    workers.dev address and the custom domain. Not a secret, app-wide (the Cloudflare account
 *    is the user's, not a vault's), never broadcast in app state.
 *  - `secrets.json` (the secrets door): `cloudflareApiToken` + `shareUploadPassword`. The upload
 *    password is generated here and uploaded with the Worker as its secret binding; the user never sees it.
 *  - `<vault>/.yaseendraw/shares.json`: which boards are shared (`shareLinks.ts`).
 *
 * The app talks to Cloudflare's API only to set things up, attach a domain or delete everything
 * (`setup.ts`); sharing, updating and stopping talk to the user's own Worker with the upload
 * password (`boards.ts`). `config.ts` is what both share.
