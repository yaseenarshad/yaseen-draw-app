/**
 * A BOARD'S HOVER PICTURE (YAZ-1800): the whole drawing, drawn in the renderer the first time the
 * mouse rests on its sidebar row and kept IN MEMORY only — nothing is written to the vault or to
 * userData. The key carries the board's mtime, the applied theme and the dark-mode colour setting
 * (🔒 YAZ-1802 D16), so any write, a theme flip or a setting change is simply a new key; the old
 * picture ages out of the bounded cache.
 *
 * An EMPTY board answers `''` — a settled answer, not a failure — so the panel can say "Empty
 * board" instead of "Preview unavailable". A board that cannot be read or drawn is the cache's
 * `null`.
