/**
 * The sidebar context menu's items AS DATA (🔒 D8, YAZ-1674). Every gating rule that used to be a
 * conditional in `ContextMenu`'s JSX is one small function here returning an item or null, so the
 * component keeps only mechanics (overlay, clamp, Escape) and the rules test PURE — no DOM.
 *
 * SIX groups, in this order (🔒 D7, amended twice): Open/View · Clipboard · Create · This row ·
 * "Open in ▸" · Delete. The component draws a separator between NON-EMPTY groups only, so a
 * blank-space menu (no row to rename or delete) never ends in a stray rule. Labels are the bare
 * text — a shortcut hint rides on `hint` and is drawn by CSS from `data-hint`, so `textContent`
 * and the accessible name stay what every test pins.
 *
 * NOTE (🔒 D7): grouping moves "Copy N paths" below the Open group, which loosens 🔒 D5 of
 * YAZ-1337 ("the plural pair leads") — "Open N in new tabs" still leads the whole menu, and the
 * plural copy still leads its own group.
 *
 * D7 amended (YAZ-1674): the OS verbs collapse into ONE "Open in ▸" parent whose flyout is itself
 * groups of leaves — the same renderer, the same separator rule, one level deep — and that parent
 * is its OWN group between the this-row group and Delete. The Open group keeps only the plural
 * open and Focus and is EMPTY on a single file row, so the clipboard group then leads.
