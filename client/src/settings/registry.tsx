/**
 * THE SETTINGS REGISTRY (YAZ-1679 D2): one array the dialog's nav, page rendering and search all
 * read. A setting is declared ONCE — id, label, hint, search keywords, and how it renders — and
 * appears in its section, in a search result, and in the nav's section list from that one entry.
 * The persistence layer (`SettingsState`, `storage.setSettings`, per-vault `github.json`) is
 * separate and untouched.
 *
 * `id` doubles as the row's `data-setting` address — for the `SettingsState` rows it IS the field
 * name, so a test or spec that knows the field knows the row.
 *
 * Two settings are NOT in `SettingsState`. GitHub sync (YAZ-1081 YAZ-1818) lives per-vault in
 * `.yaseendraw/github.json`, read and written through the engine, so its section is `available`
 * only when App hands the engine's status + setter over. The Pixabay API key (🔒 YAZ-1775 D4) lives in
 * main's owner-only `secrets.json` (YAZ-1842 D1) and is never in any renderer's state at all — its row writes
 * through `secrets:set` and reads back only "set" / "not set".
