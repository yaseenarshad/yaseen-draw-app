/**
 * Pasted / dropped image bytes → a file in the vault → an image node in the note (YAZ-1656 /
 * YAZ-1662, 🔒 D6: BYTES WIN OVER MARKUP — when the clipboard carries both an image file and HTML,
 * the file is written and the HTML is ignored, so a screenshot never lands as a dead
 * `<img src="blob:…">`).
 *
 * The write goes through `api.writeAsset`, the same door `createDrawing` uses, into the images'
 * home under the vault (`IMAGES_DIR`, made on the way by writeAsset's own `mkdir -p`). The
 * constant lives HERE rather than beside `DRAWINGS_DIR` because each asset kind's directory sits
 * next to the one writer that uses it — `drawings/createDrawing.ts` owns drawings, this owns images.
 *
 * NEVER OVERWRITE (locked, same as drawings): every write is `create: true`; `ALREADY_EXISTS`
 * retries `-2`, `-3`, … (bounded by `MAX_ATTEMPTS`) and every OTHER failure — too large, an
 * extension main refuses, a dead bridge — goes to the host's passive notice and inserts nothing.
 *
 * The node is `schema.nodes.image` — the commonmark node the editor already has (🔒 D2), so the
 * markdown out is a plain `![name](assets/images/name.png)`. The src is written ROOT-RELATIVE,
 * which is what main resolves second after note-relative, and what Obsidian would resolve too.
 * The insert lands at the LIVE selection at the moment the write resolves (never one captured
 * across the await), carries `closeHistory` so undo removes exactly the paste, and the paste
 * metas the rest of the clipboard code uses so paste rules and listeners treat it alike. A
 * SELECTED IMAGE (a `NodeSelection`) is a point AFTER it, never a range to replace: pasting a
 * screenshot with the last one still selected adds a second image, it does not eat the first.
