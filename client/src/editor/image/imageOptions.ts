/**
 * The host's side of first-class images (YAZ-1656): ONE options object, handed to `createCrepe`
 * as `opts.image`, that every image plugin in this folder reads from.
 *
 * Two consumers, two ways in:
 *  - `imageView.ts` captures it directly — `createImageView(opts)` is registered by createCrepe
 *    the way `createDrawingPreview(opts)` is.
 *  - `clipboardPaste.ts` cannot: it is a bare `$prose((ctx) => …)` with no options, and it must
 *    stay one (its paste-mode contract is the host's, not the image feature's). So createCrepe also
 *    INJECTS the options into the editor ctx under `imageOptionsCtx`, the same `Ctx` slice
 *    mechanism Milkdown's own features use for per-editor config (`imageAttr`, `editorViewOptionsCtx`).
 *    A null slice means "this editor has no image host" — paste falls through to text handling.
