/**
 * Editor continuity across an in-app rename (Links E1, GRO-2194) and an in-app DELETE
 * (GRO-2272). Editors are keyed by path, so remapping or removing a tab remounts or unmounts
 * its editor — and that unmount would flush the live scene back to the OLD path, resurrecting
 * the file the rename or delete just removed.
 *
 * Two rules, in this order:
 *  - the originating window awaits `flushRenamedPath` / `flushRenamedDir` BEFORE `fs:rename`,
 *    so what is on screen is on disk and travels with the file;
 *  - every window's `file:renamed` / `file:deleted` handler RETIRES the old handle before
 *    remapping its tabs — a retired editor never writes again, so the unmount flush is a no-op.
 *
 * Residual race, accepted: a save already in flight over IPC when the rename lands cannot be
 * recalled. The map is module-scoped, i.e. per renderer, so ANOTHER window's pending debounced
 * save for the same path is not retired either — the same race widened to a debounce interval.
 * Fixing it needs a main-side broadcast the rename path does not have today.
