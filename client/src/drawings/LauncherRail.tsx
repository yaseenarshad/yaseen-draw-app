/**
 * THE RAIL (🔒 YAZ-1775 D10): the canvas's top-left row, where the engine's own menu trigger used
 * to be (`drawingEditor.css` hides that, the web app's rule). Three controls and nothing else:
 *
 * - the HAMBURGER, which toggles the in-canvas workspace panel (`CanvasSidebar.tsx`) — open on the
 *   last-used tab, press again to close, exactly the web app's `app-sidebar-launchers__boards-menu`
 *   gesture with the target changed. It stays visible while the panel is open, because it is the
 *   other way to close it (the panel's own header hamburger is the first);
 * - WRITING and FRAMES, two icon toggles with tooltip labels, so flipping into pen mode never
 *   costs a panel. The panel's three tabs are its own strip, so the rail launches nothing else.
 *
 * THE TOGGLES WRITE A PREFERENCE, NOT THE ENGINE (🔒 YAZ-1775 D9). Both are `SettingsState.canvas` keys:
 * the rail reports the new value up, the shell stores it, the value comes back down as a prop and
 * the surface applies it to the engine. That is the same round trip Settings › Canvas takes, which
 * is why the two can never disagree — there is one value and one path, not two.
 *
 * ⚡ IDENTITY-STABLE BY CONSTRUCTION. `renderTopLeftUI` must never change identity (the memoized
 * `<Excalidraw>`'s React #185 rule, see `ExcalidrawSurface.tsx`), so this component reads live
 * state from a tiny external STORE the surface owns and subscribes to it with
 * `useSyncExternalStore` — a re-render here never re-renders the engine. Nothing in this file
 * names the engine.
