/**
 * THE ENGINE'S NAME, AND THE TWO GLOBALS IT READS AT IMPORT TIME (YAZ-878, carried into the
 * document by 🔒 YAZ-1810).
 *
 * `@excalidraw/excalidraw` is NAMED here and nowhere else: every other module reaches it through
 * `loadExcalidraw()`, so the package's identity, its lazy loading and its two startup pins live
 * in one file.
 *
 * LAZY BY CONTRACT: a dynamic `import()` fired on the first canvas mount, so the renderer's entry
 * chunk never carries the package (≈250 transitive packages and megabytes of fonts). A window
 * sitting on Welcome, or on a folder with no tab open, loads none of it.
 *
 * OFFLINE BY CONTRACT (🔒 locked): the renderer must NEVER reach a CDN. Excalidraw resolves its
 * font files against `window.EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH` and falls back to esm.sh only when that URL
 * FAILS, so the path is set — to the copy of the package's own asset folder bundled into the app
 * under `app://yaseen/excalidraw-assets/` — BEFORE the module is imported. The copy is made at
 * build time by `desktop/electron.vite.config.ts` (`excalidrawAssets()`) and never committed.
 * Fonts are fetched at all only for scenes that contain TEXT.
 *
 * The SAVE side pins the second global the same way: `serializeAsJSON` stamps `EXPORT_SOURCE`,
 * which the package reads ONCE at module-eval time as
 * `window.EXCALIDRAW_EXPORT_SOURCE || window.location.origin` — without this the app's own
 * `app://` origin would land in every file the user saves. It is set to the same `source` a new
 * drawing is born with (`drawingScene.ts`), so a file this app creates and this app edits differ
 * only in what was drawn.
 *
 * BOTH PINS MUST PRECEDE THE IMPORT, which is why they sit inside `loadExcalidraw` rather than at
 * module scope next to it: module scope would run them when THIS file is first imported, and
 * nothing guarantees that happens before some other module imports the package.
 *
 * THE THIRD PIN IS NOT A GLOBAL BUT A localStorage KEY (⚡ R4/R5, YAZ-1812), and it is the ONE
 * engine localStorage key this app touches — WRITTEN, never read. See `YASEEN_FULL_TOOLBAR_MODE`.

/**
 * THE CONTEXTUAL PROPERTIES TOOLBAR'S GATE (⚡ R4/R5). The engine's `deriveStylesPanelMode`
 * (`packages/common/src/editorInterface.ts:152-164`) answers `mobile` for a phone, `compact` for a
 * tablet, and otherwise whatever it finds under this localStorage key — read at mount and on
 * resize. `LayerUI.tsx:575` renders the fork's `<ContextualPropertiesToolbar>` (`Actions.tsx:377`)
 * — Yasin's horizontal bar, with the engine's own key hints — in the **`full`** desktop mode;
 * `LayerUI.tsx:242` renders upstream's vertical `compact-shape-actions-island` in `compact`.
 *
 * ⚡ THE NAMES READ BACKWARDS, which is why this constant exists rather than a bare string: the
 * fully built-out toolbar is `full`, and `compact` is upstream's lesser strip. Rounds 3–4 of the
 * demo had them inverted; round 5 corrected it against the fork source. There is no preference and
 * no toggle (the `propertiesToolbar` pref was removed by the round-4 amendment): this value is
 * written before EVERY mount, which is also what guards against a stray stored `compact`.
 *
 * `formFactor.ts` is the other half — without it a canvas pane narrowed by the shell sidebar falls
 * into the engine's ≤ 1180 px tablet band and is forced to `compact` before this key is consulted.
