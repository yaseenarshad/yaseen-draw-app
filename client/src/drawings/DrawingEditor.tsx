/**
 * THE DRAWING DOCUMENT (🔒 YAZ-1810): a `.excalidraw` opened full-pane in a tab. `Editor`
 * dispatches `kind === 'drawing'` here, and this is the shell's ordinary document host — save
 * chip, sync chip, conflict bar, debounced autosave, the quit handshake — with the canvas where
 * a text editor would be.
 *
 * 🔒 CHROME ONLY. The ENGINE lives behind `ExcalidrawSurface`; nothing in this file imports the
 * package, or anything that does. `DrawingEditor.test.tsx` mocks that one seam and pins the rest.
 *
 * AUTOSAVE ON THE VERSION, NOT THE BYTES. The engine reports a snapshot per pointer move. The
 * snapshot lives in a REF and `Autosave<number>` is fed only its cheap integer `version`, so a
 * drag costs one React render instead of hundreds — and serialising happens ONCE, inside
 * `save()`, when the 500 ms timer fires. The FIRST snapshot is the surface's restore-then-compare
 * baseline, so a drawing that is opened and not touched is clean and is never written back.
 *
 * EXTERNAL CHANGES. A watcher `change` on this path, once any in-flight save has settled, is our
 * own echo when its mtime matches what the save returned. Otherwise a CLEAN editor RELOADS from
 * disk and a DIRTY one raises the conflict bar (Reload / Keep mine). A `CONFLICT` from the save
 * door itself — a stale `expectedMtime`, i.e. the other window got there first — raises the same
 * bar, and `Autosave` blocks further writes until one of the two buttons answers it. Two windows
 * on one board is exactly this rule seen from both sides.
 *
 * RELOADING MUST NOT WRITE. The engine answers `updateScene` with its own `onChange`, so a naive
 * reload looks like an edit and saves the freshly-read bytes straight back. Two guards, both
 * cheap: `replaceScene` returns the version computed from the elements it handed the engine (not
 * read back from it, which races its commit), and the first snapshot after a reload is consumed
 * as the new BASELINE rather than as a change.
 *
 * ⚡ KEYS ARE THE HOST'S, NEVER `window`'s. ⌘S is caught on this element in the CAPTURE phase —
 * before the engine's own keymap sees it — and flushes now. A `window` listener would fire for
 * every mounted tab at once, and the shell keeps several mounted. The surface applies the same
 * rule to ⌘F / ⌘C, and it is why the parity checklist drops `handleKeyboardGlobally`.
 *
 * THE APPLICATION MENU'S TWO CANVAS ITEMS (🔒 YAZ-1775 D10) arrive the same way: `App` dispatches a
 * `DRAWING_COMMAND_EVENT` on the VISIBLE `.editor--drawing` section (`drawingCommand.ts`), and
 * this host claims it on its own element. Same reason as the keys — several engines are mounted,
 * and exactly one of them is in front.
 *
 * THE CHIPS ARE THE ENGINE'S TOP-RIGHT ROW, not a strip above the canvas: the canvas starts
 * directly under the tab bar, and the chips sit where the web app's cloud status does.
 *
 * 🔒 YAZ-1775 D3 ON SAVE. `unpersistedFiles` picks the canvas files the store lacks — referenced by a
 * live image element, and not among what `drawing:load` found in `assets/` plus what earlier
 * saves reported back — and ships them as `newFiles`; main writes them BEFORE the scene. A
 * legacy embedded board comes back from load as not-stored, so its first save is the shrink:
 * bytes into `assets/`, JSON down to `files: {}`. The persisted set only ever grows, so the same
 * image is never shipped twice in one session.
 *
 * RENAME AND DELETE. The host registers the shell's rename-continuity handle for its path, so a
 * rename flushes these bytes before the file moves and a DELETE retires the controller — without
 * which closing the tab would flush on unmount and resurrect the file that was just trashed.
 * `capture()` answers null on purpose: a text buffer can travel to the new path as a string, a
 * live canvas cannot, and the pre-rename flush has already put it on disk.
