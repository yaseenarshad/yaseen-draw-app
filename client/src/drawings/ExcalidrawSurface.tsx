/**
 * THE ENGINE SEAM (YAZ-879, rebuilt for the drawing DOCUMENT in 🔒 YAZ-1810, given its chrome in
 * YAZ-1812).
 *
 * 🔒 ONE FILE OWNS THE CANVAS. This is the only component that mounts `<Excalidraw>`, the only
 * one that knows how a scene serializes, and the only one that knows what "changed" means to the
 * engine. `DrawingEditor` — the autosave, the dirty state, the conflict bar, the chips — imports
 * this module's TYPES and this component and nothing else, so replacing the engine rewrites this
 * file and touches no chrome. `DrawingEditor.test.tsx` mocks this one module and pins that
 * boundary rather than trusting it.
 *
 * LAZY: the engine arrives through `engine.ts`'s `loadExcalidraw()` — one dynamic import per
 * renderer, with the offline font pin and the export-source pin already applied — and the
 * stylesheet rides the same first open, so the entry chunk stays free of both.
 *
 * SNAPSHOTS, NOT A CONTROLLED SCENE: the surface stays UNCONTROLLED (the engine owns its undo,
 * selection and tool state) and reports outward through `onSnapshot`. A snapshot is a cheap
 * change KEY — `getSceneVersion`, the engine's own sum of element versions, which is what it
 * offers for exactly this — plus a `serialize()` that costs nothing until a save fires. The
 * FIRST snapshot is emitted at mount, from the loaded scene, BEFORE the engine's own first
 * `onChange`, so the host always has a baseline to call "clean" even if the engine never
 * volunteers one. That baseline runs the disk elements through the engine's own
 * `restoreElements()` first: restore is what the engine actually mounts (it bumps element
 * `version` and materialises rounding values), so only a restore-then-compare baseline agrees
 * with the engine's first `onChange`, and an untouched drawing never reads as dirty. Restore is
 * deterministic, so the two independent runs always land on the same sum.
 *
 * ⚡ `getSceneVersion` IS A SUM, and a sum is not an identity: an undo that returns to the same
 * total reads CLEAN. Accepted on YAZ-1775 (demo round 1) — the alternative is hashing the
 * serialised scene on every pointer move, which is the cost the version exists to avoid, and the
 * failure mode is "a redundant save was skipped", not "an edit was lost".
 *
 * SHAPE ON DISK: `serializeAsJSON(…, 'local')` is the library's OWN writer — the same one its
 * "Save to disk" uses — so element cleanup is its rules, not ours. Two things are ours: the
 * `files` argument is deliberately EMPTY (🔒 YAZ-1775 D3: bytes live in `<vault>/assets/`, the scene
 * carries ids only) and a trailing newline, so a file this app creates and this app saves differ
 * only in what was drawn. A snapshot hands the host the engine's LIVE files and the ids the
 * scene still references alongside the lean JSON, so the host can work out what the store is
 * missing (`unpersistedFiles`) without ever seeing an engine type.
 *
 * ⚡ EVERY PROP HANDED TO THE ENGINE IS STABLE. `<Excalidraw>` is memoized and calls `onChange`
 * whenever it renders, so a prop rebuilt per render is a feedback loop: change → the host
 * re-renders → new `initialData` / `onChange` identity → the memo misses → change… (React error
 * #185, seen on the first mount of the original embed). Hence the module-level `UI_OPTIONS`, the
 * ref-backed callbacks, the once-only `initialData`, the launcher STORE the rail subscribes to
 * rather than props, and the host memoizing what it passes in.
 *
 * THE CHROME INSIDE THE ENGINE (🔒 YAZ-1775 D10). No `<MainMenu>` at all: the engine's own trigger is
 * hidden (`drawingEditor.css`, the web app's own rule) and its items moved out — File › Export
 * Image… ⌘⇧E and View › Canvas Background to the application menu (`drawingCommand.ts` routes
 * them to the visible drawing), Preferences to Settings › Canvas (🔒 YAZ-1775 D9). `renderTopLeftUI` is the
 * rail (`LauncherRail.tsx`: the panel hamburger plus the Writing / Frames toggles);
 * `renderTopRightUI` is the host's status chips, the slot the web app's CloudStatus sat in, so
 * they can never cover the tool island; the engine's one child is the docked workspace panel
 * (`CanvasSidebar.tsx`, ⚡ YAZ-1775 D8 amended). ⌘F / ⌘C open the Images / Components tabs with the web
 * app's guards, bound on THIS component's own element in the capture phase — never `window`.
 *
 * CANVAS PREFS BOTH WAYS (🔒 YAZ-1775 D9). `canvasPrefs` is the shell's copy, and `appliedRef` is what the
 * engine is believed to hold. Engine → shell: every `onChange` reads the prefs slice off the
 * engine's appState (`appStateToPrefs`) and, ONLY when it differs from `appliedRef`, records it
 * and reports it 300 ms later. Shell → engine: a `canvasPrefs` prop that differs from `appliedRef`
 * is pushed with `updateScene`, changed keys only, with `toolLock` merged into the CURRENT tool
 * and `framesVisible` applied through `updateFrameRendering` instead. Both directions compare
 * against that one ref before writing — that is the whole anti-ping-pong rule.
 */
/*
 * ENGINE PARITY (🔒 YAZ-1775 R3). The full record — every web-app prop, `UIOptions` field, child,
 * imperative call, startup default and editor CSS rule at fork `e72242f8`, each with its reason —
 * is the "1A · Engine parity checklist" comment on YAZ-1805. This block is the short true list.
 *
 * PORTED: `onChange` · `initialData` (the scene off disk + 🔒 YAZ-1775 D3 assets + 🔒 YAZ-1775 D9 prefs) ·
 *   `initialState` (open fitted to the content, 🔒 YAZ-1855 D1) · `theme` (live) · `detectScroll: false` · `autoFocus` · `excalidrawAPI` (the fork calls it
 *   `onExcalidrawAPI`) · `renderTopLeftUI` as the 🔒 YAZ-1775 D10 rail · `renderTopRightUI` as a slot for the
 *   shell's chips · `UIOptions.canvasActions.clearCanvas: false` · the sidebar as `CanvasSidebar`
 *   (Images / Components / Present) with the web app's ⌘F / ⌘C shortcuts and their suppression
 *   gates, its last-tab and dock memory (in the shell store), and the writing-mode and frames
 *   toggles · the Assistant-font, architect-roughness and centred-text startup defaults, as plain
 *   🔒 YAZ-1775 D9 prefs with no migration stamps.
 * ADDED (ours): `UIOptions.getFormFactor` — phone or desktop, never tablet (⚡ YAZ-1775 R5) ·
 *   `canvasActions.loadScene` and `saveToActiveFile` forced false, because autosave is the one door
 *   to the file · `excalidraw.desktopUIMode = 'full'` written before every mount (⚡ YAZ-1775 R4/R5).
 * DROPPED: everything cloud, collab, share-link, AI, Excalidraw+ and Boards/Docs · `<MainMenu>`
 *   entirely (🔒 YAZ-1775 D10 moved Export Image…, Export Drawing… and Canvas Background to the application
 *   menu, Preferences and Theme to Settings) · `langCode`, `viewModeEnabled`,
 *   `viewModeSelectionEnabled`, `renderCustomStats`, `onExport`, `onThemeChange`, `onLinkOpen`,
 *   the embeddable trio · `onImageBackgroundRemoval` (🔒 YAZ-1775 D6) · `AppWelcomeScreen`,
 *   `OverwriteConfirmDialog`, `AppFooter`, `ErrorDialog`, `DebugCanvas` and the palette's custom
 *   items · every `excalidraw-app/` localStorage key (🔒 YAZ-1775 D9).
 *   `handleKeyboardGlobally` is THE ONE DELIBERATE DROP: several tabs each mount an engine, and
 *   every one of them would answer a single global key.
 *
 * THE IMPERATIVE DOORS THIS APP USES: `updateScene` (the prefs push, the dock pref, image export,
 * canvas background, `replaceScene`) · `refresh` · `getAppState` / `getSceneElements` / `getFiles` /
 * `addFiles` (the 🔒 YAZ-1775 D3 hydrate/extract path) · `updateFrameRendering` (the frames pref's one
 * application path) · `setViewport` and `setActiveTool` (the Present tab) · `toggleSidebar` (the
 * hamburger and the two shortcuts). `focusContainer` is RE-IMPLEMENTED here: the engine keeps it
 * on its App class rather than on the imperative API, so the seam focuses `.excalidraw-container`
 * itself for the tab-reveal handoff (🔒 YAZ-1812).
