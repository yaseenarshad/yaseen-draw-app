/**
 * ALWAYS-LIVE LINKS (YAZ-1799 🔒 D3). Every successful save of a board that has a `shares.json`
 * entry re-uploads the standalone export to the SAME id, so the link always shows the board as
 * last saved.
 *
 * Coalescing, per board, in this renderer (the window whose autosave wrote the board):
 *  - SETTLE: an upload starts only after 10 s with no further save — a drawing session is many
 *    saves, and each would otherwise be a full re-upload of every image.
 *  - ONE IN FLIGHT: a board never has two uploads at once.
 *  - LATEST WINS: a save that lands mid-upload schedules one more upload after it finishes, which
 *    reads the board from disk again — so the last save is always what ends up behind the link.
 *
 * A failed upload (offline, too large, refused, not set up) keeps the share record; main records the reason
 * (the Share dialog and Settings › Sharing show it) and the next save simply tries again. Nothing
 * here retries on a timer.
 *
 * RENAMES: a board is keyed by path, so an in-app rename (`file:renamed`, via `noteBoardRenamed`)
 * re-keys whatever is pending, queued or in flight — an edit saved seconds before the rename
 * still uploads, under the new path. The upload names its link (`id`), so main lands it on the
 * record even when the rename overtakes it.
