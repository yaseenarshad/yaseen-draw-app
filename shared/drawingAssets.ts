/**
 * THE IMAGE STORE'S PURE RULES (🔒 YAZ-1775 D3 on YAZ-1775, built in YAZ-1811).
 *
 * 🔒 YAZ-1775 D3: a `.excalidraw` on disk carries `files: {}` — image ELEMENTS keep only their `fileId`,
 * and the bytes live at `<vault>/assets/<fileId>.<ext>`. The id is Excalidraw's own (the SHA-1
 * of the bytes, which the engine computes on paste, so the store is content-addressed for free)
 * and the extension follows the mime. Files are therefore IMMUTABLE: the same bytes always get
 * the same name, so a second paste of one image writes nothing and two boards share one file.
 *
 * Both processes need these rules — main resolves ids to files on load, lifts a legacy export's
 * embedded bytes on save and decides what the sweep may trash; the renderer works out which of
 * the canvas's files a save still has to ship — so they live in `shared/` once, with no fs, no
 * Electron and no engine import, and `drawingAssets.test.ts` pins them. The doors that USE them
 * are `desktop/src/main/fs/drawing.ts`, `desktop/src/main/drawings/orphanSweep.ts` and
 * `client/src/drawings/DrawingEditor.tsx`.
