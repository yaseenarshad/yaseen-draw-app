/**
 * SHARE LINK (YAZ-1799): one board, uploaded to the user's OWN Cloudflare (one R2
 * bucket + one small Worker), reachable by anyone with its long random link. ALWAYS LIVE (Yasin's
 * amendment of D3): every save of a shared board re-uploads it to the same link (`liveShare.ts`).
 *
 * WHO OWNS WHAT:
 *  - MAIN owns Cloudflare: the API token and the Worker's upload password live in `secrets.json`
 *    (the secrets door — the renderer can never read either), and every HTTP call is main's.
 *  - The RENDERER assembles the bytes (the same standalone `.excalidraw` Export Drawing writes,
 *    🔒 YAZ-1799 D3) because only it has the engine; it hands them to main to upload.
 *  - The vault remembers which boards are shared in `<vault>/.yaseendraw/shares.json`:
 *    `{ version: 1, shares: { "<vault-relative path>": { id, allowDownload, sharedAt, updatedAt } } }`.
 *  - ONE LINK per board, `/b/<id>`, plus a permission the owner flips on that same link (the
 *    Google Docs model): "can view and download" (default) or "can view only". The Worker
 *    enforces it — `/raw/<id>` is 403 when downloads are off.
 */

 * The Workers free-plan request body limit — the Worker enforces it and the app pre-checks it,
