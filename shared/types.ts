/**
 * Shared renderer/main contracts for Yaseen Draw (locked in GRO-1961, bridge in GRO-2153) —
 * see docs/CONTRACTS.md "Bridge API" and "App state schema" for the prose version.
 *
 * All paths are ABSOLUTE, POSIX-style (`/Users/...`). The main process imposes no
 * jail: any absolute path on the machine may be read or written.
 */

// The contracts are grouped by domain in `shared/types/`; this file is the one door to them,
// so every consumer keeps importing from `@shared/types` and nothing depends on the grouping.
